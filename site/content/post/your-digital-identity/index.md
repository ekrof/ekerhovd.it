## The Power of Your Digital Identity: How to Impress Future Employers

During my recent talk at ITxBergen, we explored the importance of digital identity in today’s increasingly competitive job market. As more employers look online to assess potential hires, your digital presence can be the deciding factor in whether you stand out or blend into the crowd. Let's dive into why your digital identity matters and how to make it work for you.

### Why Your Digital Identity Matters

Your digital identity is more than just a LinkedIn profile or a few GitHub repositories—it's a complete reflection of your professional self in the virtual world. Potential employers will often form an impression of you long before meeting you in person, based solely on what they find online. As I mentioned during the talk, "What you see is what your future employers see when they search for you." Ensuring that your online presence accurately represents your skills and professionalism is crucial.

### Google Yourself: See What Employers See

A simple but revealing exercise I often recommend is to Google yourself in incognito mode. This gives you an idea of what potential employers see when they look you up. If the results don’t match the professional image you want to project, it's time to take control of your digital narrative. Aim for an online presence that showcases your strengths and expertise.

### GitHub: Your Portfolio for the Tech World

For developers, GitHub is more than just a code repository—it's a place to show off your technical prowess. In many ways, it functions like a portfolio where your contributions are on display for the world to see. During the talk, I emphasized how important it is to keep your GitHub profile active and up-to-date. The contributions timeline serves as a log of your work and growth as a developer, so don’t let it go stale.

A tip I shared: “Inside GitHub Profile -> Settings –> Scroll down to include private contributions on my profile.” This keeps your activity log full, even when you’re working on private repositories or for clients.

### Create an Impressive GitHub ReadMe

Your GitHub ReadMe is like the personal sales pitch of your technical skills. A blank ReadMe is the equivalent of submitting a CV with only your name—totally ineffective. Instead, use this space to highlight your skills, projects, and areas of interest. Here’s how to make it shine:

1. Create a repository named after your GitHub account.
2. Fill your ReadMe.md with compelling content about your work.
3. Make it visually engaging to leave a lasting impression.

This will act as a live portfolio that potential employers and collaborators will value. A well-crafted ReadMe shows your ability to communicate your expertise clearly and effectively.

### Take It Further with GitHub Pages

If you really want to stand out, consider hosting your ReadMe as a personal webpage using GitHub Pages. This is a simple yet powerful way to bring your profile to life. Customizing the page with a Jekyll theme and even purchasing a custom domain can add a layer of professionalism that sets you apart from others in the field.

### Sharing is Key: Make Your Work Public

One of the central messages of the talk was the importance of sharing your journey publicly. Whether you’re publishing technical blog posts, contributing to open-source projects, or posting on platforms like LinkedIn, being visible is essential. Public sharing not only builds your personal brand but also fosters trust and credibility within the industry.

I also highlighted the "Beautiful Mess Effect," where sharing personal struggles or uncertainties in public often makes you appear more authentic and relatable. This openness can actually increase trust and connection with others, making your professional persona even more appealing.

### Your Digital Presence is Your First Impression

To wrap up, the key takeaway is simple: your digital identity is more than just code or a list of accomplishments—it’s your first impression to the world. And in today’s competitive job market, that first impression can make all the difference. By taking control of your online presence, you won't just impress employers—you’ll make them want to work with you.

### Key Tips Recap:

1. **Google Yourself**: See your online presence through the eyes of potential employers.
2. **Check Your Social Selling Index**: Use LinkedIn’s SSI to gauge your digital influence.
3. **Enhance Your GitHub**: Create a detailed and visually appealing ReadMe that acts as your portfolio.
4. **Host Your GitHub ReadMe as a Webpage**: Go the extra mile with GitHub Pages and a custom domain.
5. **Be Visible**: Share your work, challenges, and growth publicly to build credibility.

Your digital identity is your calling card—make it work for you!
